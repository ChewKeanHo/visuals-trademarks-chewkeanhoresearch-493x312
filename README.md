# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Knowledge Research Trademarks Logo 493x312 | (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Visuals

[![logo](/Pictures/banner_493x312.svg)](#)

The (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho Knowledge Research Trademarks Logo. They published
clear trademark guideline and supplied the required material files for it here.
The preferred version is `.svg` which has non-destructive scale up & down
properties and can be converted into any rasterized images (e.g. `jpeg`, `webp`,
`avif`, etc).

This project creates (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Knowledge Research Trademarks
Logo specifically for 493x312 size. This engineering specification is mainly
for Microsoft Software Installer (`.msi`) packaging deployment.




## Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Decrees

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This project deploys the use of one or more generative artificial intelligence
such as but not limited to large language model (LLM) for the following tasks:



### Data Sourcing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing enhanced web searches due to polluted search engine indexes.
> * Performing completely generated media such as but not limited to images,
>   videos, and audios.

* Used for data and reading material searching as the search engine across the
  Internet had collapsed due to A.I publication slops.
* Used for grammar and language correction detection on the human-made written
  script.



### Data Processing & Analytics

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing development via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *agentic AI processing*).
> * Performing data analytics via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *AI vibing*).
> * Performing dedicated and task specific work where conventional technologies
>   could not achieve such as but not limited to upscaling an image verbatim.

No deployment.



### Data Testing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing end-user use case simulated testings.

No deployment.



### Data Visualization

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing completely generated data visualization via multi-step queries
>   (also known as *vibe coding*).

No deployment.



### Data Archiving & Deletion

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing data clean-up via multi-step queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding*).

No deployment.




## Maintainers' Notes

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

Since (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho published its brand and trademark guideline,
**you MUST go through the following to avoid any unwanted legal implications**:

* https://github.com/chewkeanho/legals-policies-trademark
* Standard Global Trademark Laws
* Local Trademark Laws

While not specified by (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho, please ensure the outputs are
also web ready. Refer:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/How_to/Define_app_icons
* https://web.dev/articles/maskable-icon
* https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-for-websites/cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/images/

For software supply chain, to guarentee the trademarks **ARE NOT** vendor-locked
by any expensive or proprietary software, please **ONLY USE AND SUPPORT** open
source image editing software specifically as follows:

* **GIMP (https://gimp.org)** - for their very amazing alternate format exports
  (e.g. `avif`, `webp`, `jpg`, `ico`, and `png`) functions.
* **Inkscape (https://inkscape.org)** - for vector graphics maintenances and
  exporting SVG plain vector files.

For directory organizations:

* The principal canvas **MUST BE SAVED** in `inkscape SVG format` and retain all
  legal attributes (license, copyright, etc). The files **MUST HAVE**
  `inkscape-` prefixes to avoid confusion. They are saved inside
  `/Pictures/trademarks/principal-canvas` directory.
* The exported svg **MUST BE IN** `Plain SVG format` and retain all legal
  attributes (license, copright, etc). The files **MUST NOT HAVE** `inkscape-`
  prefixes. They are saved inside `/Pictures/trademarks` directory.
* The main-course **MUST** always be `.svg` as end-user can use GIMP to convert
  into other formats.
* Therefore, additional non-text based images (e.g. `.ico`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, and
  `.avif`) should be published in `Release` section as "Good to Have" convenient
  side-dishes.

For artificial intelligence:

* **ONLY USE** for internal research or Internet searches internally.
* **Any automated or "vibe" output commitments are STRICTLY PROHIBITED**.
  * This is a legal binding project; **DO NOT LET ANY** A.I. near any of your
    code and files commitment.
  * If you sign-off any A.I. commitment, **YOU WILL BE HELD FULLY LIABLE FOR
    ALL ITS CONCEQUENCES**.
  * Therefore: **STRICTLY HUMAN COMMITMENT**.
* **Use of passive A.I. (e.g. image upscaling) is rare to none** since
  the trademark graphic materials **MUST** be vectorized as its first rule.
